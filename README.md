# React Component Collection

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ZSturman/React-Component-Collection)

This repo is a growing collection of React components designed to enhance the development of your applications. 

## Current Features

### Form Wizard

The `Form Wizard` component provides a user-friendly, step-by-step guide for completing complex forms. It's designed to make the process of filling out forms easier and more organized.

- **How It Works**: The Form Wizard divides the form into multiple steps, with each step containing specific fields. Users can navigate between steps using "Back" and "Next" buttons, ensuring they can review and correct their entries.

- **Setup**: Import the Form Wizard component into your project and include it in your JSX/ TSX. The wizard handles its own state and step navigation.
